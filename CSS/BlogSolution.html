        Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
        bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do.
        That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
        way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our
        lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and
        I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

        The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of
        the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name
        of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
        darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost
        children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and
        furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
        And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
